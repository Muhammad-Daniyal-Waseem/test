## THE BALANCED APPROACH RATIONALE

### Why This is Better:

**60px headers (not 72px):**
- Stripe uses ~56px
- Linear uses ~64px
- Figma uses ~52px
- Your 60px fits right in the elite range

**80px section padding (not 96px):**
- Elite sites range from 64px-96px
- 80px is the sweet spot
- Premium feel without being wasteful
- Better scroll-to-conversion ratio

### Confidence Over Volume:

**Before:** Site felt like it was SHOUTING
**After:** Site feels like it's CONFIDENT

Elite brands don't shout. They speak clearly and let the content do the work.
